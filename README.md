# How can I get the calendar ?

You can get the calendar by clicking on the "Télécharger le calendrier" button in the "Calendrier" at https://cfa.42.fr/students/calendars.
The calendar must be a .xlsx file.

# Usage:

_Run `make install ` to set up the project._

`python rncp_validator/checker.py <calendar.xlsx or dir> <list of .git path>`

_If you give to the script a directory of calendars, the program will analyse each xlsx files._

_You can also give to the script multiple .git paths to analyse all at once._
